The infrastructure simply didn't exist. Be that as it may, the film's reception was overwhelmingly positive. By all accounts it was one of those \"history was made in an instant\" moments. Disney's vision paid off. [...] In this week's Tales from the Box Office, we're looking back at 1937's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in honor of the release of Disney's new live-action \"Snow White.\" We'll go over how the film came to be, why it was so groundbreaking, what happened when it hit theaters, its various re-releases over the years, what happened in the years after its release, and what lessons we can learn from it all the years later. Let's dig in, shall we?\n\n## The movie: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs",

Released in 1953, Peter Pan features frequent use of an anti-indigenous slur and perpetuates stereotypes through its portrayal of indigenous peoples as “fat and ugly.” Additionally, white characters mock the traditional native clothing and culture. This racism is explicit in “What Makes the Red Man Red,” which has garnered controversy because of its use of racist and derogatory terms. [...] Stereotypical representations of indigenous peoples are also seen in Disney’s 1995 film, Pocahontas, which romanticizes historical occurrences, hypersexualizes indigenous women using high-cut, one-shoulder dresses with plunging necklines, and includes violent and offensive language toward indigenous peoples. [...] Later, in 1946, Disney released the movie that is arguably the most notorious for its racial insensitivity. Song of the South includes racist portrayals of African Americans, basing most of the characters on stereotypes. It also glorifies plantation life, perpetuating the myth of slaves being happy in the cotton fields. While it cannot be found on any streaming services in the United States and was never released on any home video format, it’s still present in the form of Disney’s Splash",

    "content": "Disney had flagged “Dumbo” for racial insensitivity — including a crow named “Jim Crow” — and “Peter Pan” received a content warning for its stereotypical portrayal of Native Americans, with its character the “Indian Chief.”\n\nThe warnings have been tied to several of Disney’s other classic films, including “The Jungle Book,” “Lady and the Tramp” and “The Aristocats.” [...] #### Recommended\n\nSkip to main content\n\nDisney is reportedly scrapping the content warnings for its animated classics that have racially charged storylines, like “Dumbo” and “Peter Pan” — a stark reversal as the company seeks to comply with President Trump’s DEI crackdown.\n\nThe entertainment giant will move the disclaimers that flash at the start of the movie on its streaming platform to the “details” section and significantly trim down the language, sources told Axios. [...] The company — which faced controversy on its battle with Florida over the “Don’t Say Gay” bill — has been rolling back some of its diversity programs since Trump signed an executive order banning DEI initiatives at the federal level and urged private firms to retract their policies.\n\nIt’s not the first time Disney has changed the content warnings that appear before some of its animated classics.\n\nIn November 2019, the company introduced the labels in front of some of its 1940s and 1950s films.",

[...] In eighth grade, our history teacher taught us about US Western expansion from the perspective of the Indigenous tribes, who experienced it as an invasion of their land.
